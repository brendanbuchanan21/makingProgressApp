Workout Tracker App 
A full-stack workout tracker built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), with Redux handling global state. The goal of this app is to provide a simple but powerful way to track total work done over timeâ€”an important but often overlooked metric in fitness tracking.

 Why This App?
Most workout apps focus on variables like intensity, heart rate, or estimated calories burned. While useful, these are often inconsistent and hard to measure reliably. Instead, this app emphasizes workload volumeâ€”a measurable and consistent indicator of progress based on sets, reps, and weight lifted over time.
